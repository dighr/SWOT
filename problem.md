title: Why SWOT?
---

<b>The Problem</b><br>
Chlorination is the most widely practised water treatment technique used to
meet the objective of safe water supply to refugee and internally displaced
persons. If well managed, it can ensure ‘residual’ protection from further
contamination up to the household level, with massive benefits to the
overall public health. Humanitarian agencies routinely collect, monitor and
report chlorination data, but often little is done with this information to better
optimise treatment. Compliance with guidelines up to the final point of water
consumption must be guaranteed.

<b>The Solution</b><br>
The proper management and analysis of routinely collected residual chlorine
data using appropriate statistical techniques will provide humanitarian field
workers with better, site-specific, and evidence-based operational
guidance . The Safe Water Optimisation Tool (SWOT) is being developed with
this primary objective.

<b>Benefits of SWOT</b><br>
* Improvement to overall public health – reduction in the incidence of water borne disease
* Establish site-specific guidance to ensure better compliance with chlorination standards at the household level
* Better accountability to populations and donors
* Helps highlight problematic areas or practices towards which resources can be focused during water supply interventions or outbreak control.
