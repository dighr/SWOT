The Safe Water Optimization Tool is designed to integrate into existing humanitarian operations by using data that is already collected in the field. The SWOT provides an accessible platform to manage data and integrates advanced machine learning to generate site-specific and evidenced based water treatment recommendations for field teams.

<h2>Step 1: Input</h2>
Paired and time-stamped water quality monitoring data collected at distribution points and households.
<p style="font-size:75%"><i>Data collection can be achieved using either a digital platform or a paper-pen-to-spreadsheet approach</i></p>

<h2>Step 2: Data Management</h2>
Cloud-based data storage provides a secure repository for historical data which can be used for reporting.

<h2>Step 3: Data Processing</h2>
Web-based analysis of data uses a sophisticated machine learning approach which can include analysis of various water quality parameters

<h2>Step 1: Input</h2>
Field workders receive guidance for the residual chlorine level required at distribution points to ensure safe water supply up to the moment of consumption in the household.
<p style="font-size:75%"><i>Guidance can be viewed online and sent by text (SMS) and email.</i></p>
