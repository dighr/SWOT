He has worked with Médecins Sans Frontières and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in South Sudan, Pakistan, Jordan, Rwanda, and Uganda. Imran has taught at the University of California, Berkeley, where he did a postdoctoral fellowship developing the first evidence-based guidance for water treatment in emergencies, which the SWOT Project now builds upon. Imran received his doctorate in environmental engineering from the University of Guelph (Canada) and his bachelors in engineering from Queen’s University (Canada).

<h3>Jean-Francois (Jeff) Fesselet, Project Manager</h3>
<b>WatSan Unit Coordinator, Public Health Department, MSF OCA</b><br>
Jeff has spent 25 years with MSF, starting in the field working in different positions and contexts. In 1999, he started working at headquarters and has since been involved in several large scale emergency responses, leading the research and development portfolio, contributing to technical and management trainings, participating in strategic plans, managing a team of up to 6 advisors and contributing to technical and topic specific guidelines. Jeff received his postgraduate degree in Rural Development from Institute Bioforce (France) and holds a Master in Tropical Public Health Engineering from University of Leeds (UK).

<h3>Matt Arnold, Technical Advisor</h3>
<b>SWOT Technical Advisor, DIGHR</b><br>
Matt is a hydrogeologist and humanitarian. He started working as a Technical Advisor at the Dahdaleh Institute of Global Health Research in June 2018. Prior to that, and since 2003, he worked for MSF, both in the field and as a Technical Advisor at HQ level. This work necessitated supporting and implementing water supply and sanitation projects in many humanitarian emergencies and contexts – from natural disasters and disease outbreaks to population displacements. With an MSc in Hydrogeology from the University of Birmingham (UK) and a keen interest in public health and water quality, he is looking to further investigate and research issues in these domains with a view to improving the quality of water supplied to medical facilities and populations in precarious situations.

<h3>Mike Spendlove, Software Solutions Advisor</h3>

<h3>Saad Ali, Engineering Optimization Lead</h3>
<b>Control Systems Designer, Turnkey Modular Systems Inc.</b><br>
Saad helps design and build modular systems for the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. He graduated from the University of Waterloo (Canada) with a BASc and from the University of Toronto (Canada) with an MEng in Chemical Engineering. This degree was focused on engineering and globalization which included learning about big data and appropriate technology for global development. This interest in data analytics stems back a few years where he participated in various data science competitions hosted on Kaggle. After graduating, Saad was involved with the Reinventing the Toilet Challenge issued by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The team at the University of Toronto was developing a cutting-edge technology to disinfect human waste with a low cost, low water, low power, and low emissions method. On this project, Saad was involved with developing and testing the technology as well as building the control system that automated the technology. This led to his current position as more of an electrical engineer where he designs control panels and systems for the automation of pharmaceutical equipment, allowing them to produce vaccines and other active pharmaceutical ingredients.
