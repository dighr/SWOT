            <p>At Artsen zonder Grenzen (hereinafter MSF) we put great importance on the protection of your personal data. We process your personal data with the utmost care and fully in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Dutch General Data Protection Regulation Implementation Act. This Notice explains when and how we collect your personal data when you use the Safe Water Optimization Tool (SWOT) Website and the rights you have over your own information.</p>

            <h2>Information about who we are</h2>
            <p>MSF is the 'responsible' in the sense of the GDPR and therefore responsible for the correct and legitimate processing of your personal data. MSF is registered at Plantage Middenlaan 14, 1018 DD in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.</p>

            <h2>Cookies on our website </h2>
            <p>When you visit our website, we use cookies to collect standard internet log-on information and details of visitor behavior patterns (e.g. to find out the number of visitors to different parts of the site). This enables us to analyze and improve the content of our site and the navigation experience of users. We do not use this information to attempt to find out the identities of those visiting our website.</p>
            <p>For full details of the cookies used on our website, see our Cookies Notice. You can disable or delete some or all cookies in your browser setting, although this may affect some parts of the site's functionality. </p>

            <h2>The information we collect about you</h2>
            <p>There are several ways that you may provide personal data to MSF, including when you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Register for an account under the SWOT app</li>
              <li>Sign up to receive email updates</li>
              <li>Contact us with questions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, when you use the SWOT app, you will be requested to provide water quality monitoring data related to a particular site or water supply system. The way we store, process, and access this data is different to the personal information you share with us.</p>
            <p>When you contact us to set up an account to use the SWOT or with any questions about the use of the tool, we will ask you for your:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Full name</li>
              <li>Organization</li>
              <li>Email address</li>
              <li>Phone number</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will use these data only to set up your account to use the SWOT (if this was requested) or to respond to your inquiry. When you activate your account to use the SWOT, we will collect information about your account activity while using the SWOT.</p>
            <p>We may use this information and the contact information you have provided us with to contact you with any questions relating to your use of the SWOT or to obtain your feedback about the SWOT.</p>
            <p>We will keep your personal contact information until you have asked us to deactivate your SWOT account and for limited period after your account has been deactivated in order to contact you for feedback about the SWOT, or about the data you have uploaded to the SWOT. We will keep your organization name on record indefinitely for internal and marketing purposes.</p>

            <h2>What information do we collect from you, for what purposes and how long do we keep your personal data for?</h2>
            <p></p>
            <h4>Use of the Safe Water Optimization Tool:</h4>
            <p>If you choose to use the SWOT, you will be required to provide water quality data (for example by uploading a spreadsheet or .csv file). Any information you share with us through the tool, may be stored, processed, and accessed by us to help us monitor and improve the performance of the app, to provide support, or for our research purposes. We reserve the right to keep this data indefinitely.</p>
            <h4>Data required to use the SWOT:</h4>
            <p>Use of the SWOT requires submitting data about the water quality at a specific location. The SWOT uses this information to provide recommendations about water treatment. The types of data required to produce a recommendation include water quality parameters such as water temperature, electrical conductivity, and concentrations of free residual chlorine; as well as information about the date and time that these measurements were taken. No personally identifiable information beyond your account information is required.</p>
            <h4>Other data:</h4>
            <p>When you upload this data into the SWOT, you may also link the data to information we store about an organization, project, or geographical location. Any file that you upload to the SWOT may contain other types of data other than that required by the app. Files uploaded to the SWOT are stored in their original, unencrypted form to help us monitor the performance of the app and to provide support.</p>
            <p>It is important that you comply with your organization's own data protection policy when sharing monitoring information with us. In particular, you must ensure that any personally identifiable information (for example, names, contact information, household locations etc.) are removed from datasets before sharing them with us. We will never ask for personally identifiable information related to project beneficiaries or other people your organization works with.</p>
            <h4>Subscribing to the newsletter:</h4>
            <p>When you subscribe to the SWOT newsletter, we will ask you for your email address. We will use your email address only to provide you with the requested newsletter. We will delete your personal data when you ask us to unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list.</p>

            <h2>Who has access to this information?</h2>
            <p>The Safe Water Optimization Tool is a collaboration between the Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research at York University (Toronto, Canada) and Artsen zonder Grenzen/Médecins Sans Frontières (Amsterdam, The Netherlands). We use other organizations to help us process personal data and perform certain activities on our behalf. Our partners are allowed to use the personal data only for the assignment they receive from us and are obliged to use your personal data carefully and secure them. Our partners must keep the personal data confidential and destroy it after use. We always make clear agreements about this in advance.</p>
            <p>We will never sell your data or make it available to other organizations or companies.</p>

            <h2>How do we protect your personal information?</h2>
            <p>We have taken the appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data. We ensure the safety of your personal data not only electronically (through measures such as, but not restricted to, encryption at rest and in transit, use of firewalls, use of individually assigned accounts, or updating software and running patches), but also physically (for example by keeping only necessary files on paper, in locked cabinets, and by having access cards), and through organizational measures such as training our staff accordingly, and ensuring that they do their best to protect your data.</p>

            <h2>What is the legal basis for the processing of personal data?</h2>
            <p>We process your personal data relating to your account to use the Safe Water Optimization Tool or to the questions/messages you have shared with us based on our legitimate interest, as it is necessary for us to understand the use of the tool, the frequently asked questions, and your feedback. Furthermore, it is important for us to manage the users in order to ensure the security of the personal data.</p>
