title: What it is

<h2>Background</h2>
Chlorination is the most widely practised water treatment technique used to ensure the safety of water supplied to populations in precarious situations. If well managed, it can ensure residual protection from further contamination up to the point of water consumption in the household.

</h2>The Problem</h2>
Humanitarian agencies prioritize water safety and routinely collect, monitor and report residual chlorination data. Little is done, however, to leverage this information to ensure that water quality complies with safety guidelines <em>at the point of consumption</em>, a significant oversight in response efforts.

<b>The Solution</b><br>
The proper management and analysis of routinely collected residual chlorine data, using appropriate statistical techniques, will provide humanitarian field workers with high-quality, site-specific, and evidence-based operational guidance. The Safe Water Optimisation Tool (SWOT) is being developed with this primary objective.

</h2>Benefits of the SWOT</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improve public health by reducing the incidence of water borne disease</li>
<li>Establish site-specific guidance to ensure better compliance with chlorination standards at the household level</li>
<li>Provides a secure repository for historical data which can then be sued for reporting purposes</li>
<li>Improve accountability to populations and donors</li>
<li>Highlight problematic areas or practices towards which resources can be focused during water supply or outbreak control interventions</li>
</ul>
