title: What is the SWOT?
---
<h2>Background</h2>
Chlorination is the most widely used method for treating water and ensuring it is safe to drink during humanitarian emergencies. If properly managed, it can provide protection against pathogenic contamination right up to the point of consumption at the household level in camp settings.

<h2>The Problem</h2>
The water treatment guidelines currently used by humanitarian agencies are not based on any field evidence. This means that they often fail to ensure that water remains safe to drink when people actually drink it in emergency settings. 

While humanitarian agencies routinely collect, monitor, and report residual chlorination data, little is done to leverage this information to ensure that the public health goal of safe water is realized. This is a significant oversight in current humanitarian response efforts.

<h2>The Solution</h2>
The SWOT unlocks life-saving information inside water quality data by using machine learning & advanced data analytics to generate site-specific, evidence-based FRC targets, for any field setting. The SWOT helps field teams ensure that water remains safe to drink many hours after distribution from tapstands. The SWOT also helps fields teams better manage water quality by providing a means to centralize and analyze water quality monitoring data at multiple project sites.

<h2>The Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improves public health by reducing the incidence of waterborne disease.</li>
<li>Generates site-specific, evidence-based FRC targets that ensure water remains safe up to the point of consumption at the household level.</li>
<li>Provides a secure repository for historical data which can be used for reporting purposes.</li>
<li>Improves accountability to populations and donors.</li>
<li>Highlights problematic areas or practices toward which resources can be applied during water supply or outbreak control interventions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supporting Research</h2>
The SWOT builds on years of engineering and field research led by MSF, York University, UNHCR, and University of California, Berkeley:<br>
