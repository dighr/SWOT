<br>
Waterborne diseases are among the leading threats people living in refugee and internally displaced persons (IDP) camps face. Ensuring adequate quantities of safe water is essential for protecting public health.<br>
<br>
There's a problem though. The emergency water treatment guidelines currently used by humanitarian agencies are not based on any field evidence. This means that they often fail to ensure that water remains safe where and when people actually drink it.</br>

<strong>The Safe Water Optimization Tool (SWOT) emerges to fix this critical gap.</strong> <br>

<br> The SWOT goes live Dec 2019. In the meanwhile, explore this site to learn more.</strong><br>
