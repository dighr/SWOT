title: What is the SWOT?
---
<h2>Background</h2>
Chlorination is the most widely used method for treating water and ensuring water safety in humanitarian emergencies. If properly managed, it can provide protection from pathogenic recontamination right up to the point of water consumption in the household.

<h2>The Problem</h2>
The emergency water treatment guidelines currently used by humanitarian agencies are not based on any field evidence. This means that they often fail to ensure that water remains safe when people actually drink it in the household. While humanitarian agencies routinely collect, monitor, and report residual chlorination data, little is done to leverage this information to ensure that water is safe at the point of consumption and the public health goal is realized. This is a significant oversight in current humanitarian response.

<h2>The Solution</h2>
The SWOT unlocks potentially life-saving information inside water quality data by using machine learning & advanced data analytics to generate <strong> site-specific, evidence-based FRC targets for any field setting </strong>. The SWOT helps field workers ensure that water is safe to drink at the point of consumption in peopleâ€™s shelters hours after distribution from tapstands. The SWOT also helps fields teams better manage water quality in projects by providing a means to centralize and analyze water quality monitoring data.

<h2>The Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improves public health by reducing the incidence of waterborne disease</li>
<li>Generates site-specific, evidence-based FRC guidance to ensure water is safe at the point of consumption at the household</li>
<li>Provides a secure repository for historical data which can be used for reporting and decision-making</li>
<li>Improves accountability to populations and donors</li>
<li>Highlights problematic areas or practices toward which resources can be applied during water supply or outbreak control interventions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supporting Research</h2>
The SWOT builds on years of engineering and field research led by MSF, York University, UNHCR, and University of California, Berkeley. Research resources undergirding the SWOT can be found via the following links:<br>
