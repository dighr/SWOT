Safe Water Optimization Tool Technical Advisor, Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research<br>
Matt started working as a Technical Advisor at The Dahdaleh Institute of Global Health Research in June 2018. Prior to moving to Canada recently he worked for Médecins Sans Frontières as a Water and Sanitation Advisor at HQ level and as field staff since 2003.
