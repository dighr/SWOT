Chlorination is the most widely practised water treatment technique used to
meet the objective of safe water supply to refugee and internally displaced
persons. If well managed, it can ensure ‘residual’ protection from further
contamination up to the household level, with massive benefits to the
overall public health. Humanitarian agencies routinely collect, monitor and
report chlorination data, but often little is done with this information to better
optimise treatment. Compliance with guidelines up to the final point of water
consumption must be guaranteed.
