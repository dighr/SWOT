<ul>
    <li>
        <b>INPUT:</b> Paired and time-stamped water quality monitoring data collected at distribution points and households.
        Data collection can be achieved using either a digital platform or  a ‘paper-pen-to-spreadsheet’ approach.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>DATA MANAGEMENT</b>: Cloud-based data storage.
        Provides a secure repository for historical data which can then be used for reporting purposes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>DATA PROCESSING</b>: Web-based analysis of data using a sophisticated machine learning approach.
        Various water quality parameters can be included for analysis.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>THE OUTPUT</b>: Concrete guidance for the residual chlorine level required at the distribution points to assure safe water supply up to the moment of consumption in the household.
    </li>
</ul>
